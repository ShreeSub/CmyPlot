## Labels Info

We have created labels for each issue for proper ordering and this will help you select an issue you would like to work on.

- The [`logistics` label](https://github.com/bradley-erickson/CmyPlot/projects/1?card_filter_query=label%3Alogistics) is for problems regarding the entire documentation of this repo.

- The [`enchancement` label](https://github.com/bradley-erickson/CmyPlot/projects/1?card_filter_query=label%3Aenhancement) is for problems regarding any new / existing feature additions to be made in the project.

- The [`bug` label](https://github.com/bradley-erickson/CmyPlot/projects/1?card_filter_query=label%3Abug) is for problems related to any bugs or fixes than need to be taken care of.

- The [`Stretch goal` label](https://github.com/bradley-erickson/CmyPlot/projects/1?card_filter_query=label%3A%22stretch+goal%22) is for the features to be added in the next Phase of the project.

- As this is a group project, the [`Group Work` label](https://github.com/bradley-erickson/CmyPlot/projects/1?card_filter_query=label%3A%22group+work%22) was meant for issues that needed a group vote in-order to be resolved.
